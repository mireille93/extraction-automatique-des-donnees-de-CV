 AI Grand Challenge HACKATHON Vietnam: 
Hanoi, 6th, Deep Learning for the recognition of 
human activity based on sensors to ensure the safety 
of women and children,  July 12-14,2019 
Team: IFI STUDENTS (4 people) 
 
 
 
 
 
 Framed Personal Work : This project aims to study the methods, technique and 
 tools for the stock market and to build a prototype. 
Stock Market Prediction with Deep Learning || 8 months || (IFI) International 
Francophone Institute, UNV Hanoi(Vietnam) || Nov.2018-Jun.2019 || 
It was a supervised research project which is spread throughout the first year of Master.

Proposed solution 
 Practical work 
 •  Algorithm used: RNN-LSTM 
•  Date Set Used:  GOOGLE Stock Price (Historical prices 2009-2018) 
•  Obtained result: Prediction rate =50,27%, MAE:mean absolute error=0.04 degrees 
•  Used tools:Python,Numpy,Keras,Pandas 
  
 Face recognition in a video and saved in a file: ( Individual wor k) || Aout.-Nov.2019 || 
0 
 •  Goals: Recognize, crop and save faces as images from video 
•  Used tools: Python, Open CV, face_recognition 
  
FULL CHANNEL IMAGE PROCESSING (Work in pair) || March-Jun.2019 || 
 
       •      Description: Realization of a complete chain of image processing. 
       •      Goals: Make pre-segmentation (conversion of grayscale images to make them easier 
treatment), segmentation (use of OTSU algorithm on input images) and post-segmentation 
(application of labelling the image regions by using the Canny OpenCV function to detect  
edges in the images). 
       •    Used Tools : C++, OpenCV. 
Object Recognition : 
Using SIFT detector to compute the keypoints and descriptors of the training set (dataset) and 
from that we use the Flann based Matcher to recognize images classes from the test set also 
display the confusion matrix. 
      •     Used Tools : Python Open CV. 
 A Web Application that Uses Customer's Emotion to Recommend Food [In progress]  
Context:
